# Segmenting WSI images using CNNs
This folder contains the model files including pre-trained encoder. Our encoder-decoder network that incorporates input-aware residual convolutional units, dense connections between encoder and decoder, and multiple decoding paths is contained in **Model_MRIADCMD.lua** file. Please read our paper for more details.
