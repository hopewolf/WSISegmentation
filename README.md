# WSI Segmentation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains the source code of our paper [Learning to Segment Breast Biopsy Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02554.pdf)

## Training Semantic Segmentation Model
You can train you model by executing the following command:
  ```
      CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 th main.lua
  ```
If you wish to modify the parameters, you can pass command line arguments, as below. See **opts.lua** for mode command-line options
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 th main.lua -lr 0.0001
```
The above command will run the code with an initial learning rate of 0.0001.
